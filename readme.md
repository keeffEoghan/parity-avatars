# Parity Avatars

Generative avatars for Parity staff as unique NFTs that evolve with their careers.

## Temporary Demo

See the temporary live demo on the [separate GitHub Pages site](https://epok.tech/wip-project-demo-1/).
This is hosted from a public repository, which contains no obvious references to the project specifics and only the compiled code of this project; this can be done from this repository as follows (but ensure there's no `.env` in the root!):
```bash
yarn dist:fresh && rm -rf path/to/wip-project-demo-1/* && cp -R dist/* path/to/wip-project-demo-1/
```
